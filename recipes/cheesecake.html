<p>Japanese cheesecake, also known as cotton cheesecake, is a light and fluffy dessert that combines the creamy richness of traditional cheesecake with the airy texture of a soufflé. It has a delicate sweetness and a melt-in-your-mouth consistency, making it a delightful treat. Japanese cheesecake is often enjoyed on its own or with a dusting of powdered sugar, fresh berries, or a drizzle of fruit sauce</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>250 grams of cream cheese</li>
<li>50 grams of unsalted butter</li>
<li>100 ml of milk</li>
<li>60 grams of cake flour</li>
<li>4 large eggs (separated)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Prepare the Base:

        Preheat your oven to 160°C (320°F). Grease and line a 7-inch round cake pan with parchment paper.
        In a heatproof bowl, melt the cream cheese, butter, and milk over a pot of simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
        </li>

        <li>Mix the Batter:
        
        Sift the cake flour into the cream cheese mixture and mix until well combined.
        Add the egg yolks and mix until the batter is smooth.
    </li>
        <li>Whisk the Egg Whites:
        
        In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form.
        Gradually add sugar to the egg whites and continue whisking until stiff peaks form.
        </li>

        <li>Combine Mixtures:
        
        Gently fold one-third of the egg white mixture into the cream cheese batter to lighten it.
        Carefully fold in the remaining egg whites until fully incorporated, taking care not to deflate the mixture.
        </li>
        
        <li> 
            Bake the Cheesecake:
        
        Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Tap the pan lightly on the counter to remove any air bubbles.
        Place the cake pan in a larger baking dish filled with hot water (water bath) and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
        Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly ajar for 15 minutes. Then, remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely before removing from the pan and serving.
