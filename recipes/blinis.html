        Blinis are small, fluffy pancakes made from a mixture of buckwheat and all-purpose flour, often served as an appetizer or snack. They have a light, airy texture and a subtle, slightly nutty flavor. Blinis are traditionally enjoyed with toppings such as sour cream, caviar, smoked salmon, and fresh dill.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

   <ul>100 grams of buckwheat flour </ul>  
   <ul> 100 grams of all-purpose flour</ul>
<ul>250 ml of milk</ul>
<ul>2 large eggs</ul>
<ul>7 grams (1 packet) of active dry yeast</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoon of salt</ul>
<h2> Instructions </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Batter:

        Warm the milk gently until it is lukewarm (about 37°C or 98°F).
        In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in 50 ml of the lukewarm milk. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt.
        Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture and the remaining milk.
        Separate the eggs, placing the yolks in the flour mixture and the whites in a separate bowl.
        Mix the flour mixture with the milk and yolks until you get a smooth batter. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it rest in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until the batter has doubled in size.

        Whisk the Egg Whites:
        
        Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.
        Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the risen batter until well incorporated.
       </li> 
        <li> Cook the Blinis:
        
        Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.
        Pour a small amount of batter (about 1-2 tablespoons) onto the skillet to form small pancakes, about 2-3 inches in diameter.
        Cook the blinis for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.
        Transfer the cooked blinis to a plate and keep them warm while you cook the remaining batter.
        </li>

        Blinis are best served warm. They can be topped with a variety of ingredients such as sour cream, caviar, smoked salmon, dill, or any topping of your choice.</li>
